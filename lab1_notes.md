# Quantum Fourier Transform
The quantum Fourier transformation is relevant in quantum computation as it yields exponential runtime speedups compared to the classical discrete Fourier transformation and is also included in Shor's algorithm for polynomial-time integer factorization.

# Depth
The depth of a quantum circuit indicates the time required to executed a quantum circuit on a quantum computer and is defined as the longest chain of quantum gates from the start to the end of a quantum circuit that need to be computed consecutively.
