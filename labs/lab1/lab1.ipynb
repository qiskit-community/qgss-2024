Whenever the qubit assignment changes, additional operations such as swap gates must be inserted into the quantum circuit.

    "Therefore, we try to reduce the QFT quantum circuit size after transpilation by at least 20% compared to Qiskit's default transpilation. Note that you can achieve this reduction in circuit size by only using a suitable selection of passes included in Qiskit. It is not necessary to create a new pass. Review the second half of the transpilation lecture given by Matthew Treinish to get an insight into the different transpiler stages. In particular, this exercise requires setting a routing method that works especially well on star-shaped quantum circuits in combination with an optimization stage that removes superfluous two-qubit gates in a two-qubit block. These two stages are sufficient to reduce the transpilation effort below the given 20% threshold."

    "* First try to set a routing method that is especially well suited for star-shaped quantum circuits such as QFT. The routing method may appear to require a larger amount of two-qubit gates because of superfluous two-qubit gates. These should be removed by a subsequent optimization stage.\n",
    "* Note that for a block of two-qubit and single-qubit gates on a pair of qubits, at most three CX gates and (up to eight) single-qubit gates are necessary. If you notice that your quantum circuit has two-qubit blocks with more CX gates, apply passes such as `UnitarySynthesis` (and its prerequisites `ConsolidateBlocks`, `Collect2qBlocks`) to rectify this.\n",
    "* Reaching the 20% threshold is entirely possible by only setting the routing stage and optimization stage, other stages such as the layout stage are not required to be set to reach that threshold.\n",
