    "Transpilation transforms a (potentially abstract) quantum computation to a *physical* quantum circuit that is compliant to a given quantum computer, i.e. can directly be executed by a suitable device (also called an [ISA circuit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/isa-circuits)).\n",
    "In order to yield a hardware-compliant quantum circuit, transpilation must define for each time step which physical resource of a quantum computer is performing what computation while considering that typically only a subset of qubits can interact in a specific way.\n",
    "This process is divided into two tasks:\n",
    "* Synthesis translates the quantum gates in an input quantum circuit to the set of quantum gates supported by the target quantum computer. The set of quantum gates supported by a target quantum computer is also called *basis gate set*. \n",
    "* Routing assigns the qubits of a quantum circuit to the qubits of a quantum computer in each time step. Whenever the qubit assignment changes, additional operations such as swap gates must be inserted into the quantum circuit. When the target quantum computer has a restricted *qubit connectivity*, the qubit assignment must change often to ensure that each quantum gate is only performed on qubits that are connected, i.e. qubits that can interact with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transpilation process additionally optimizes the physical quantum circuit to increase the probability of obtaining the correct result.\n",
    "This optimization step typically improves *characteristics* such as the size or duration of a physical quantum circuit given e.g. in number of quantum gates.\n",

    "The definition of `backend` includes a coupling map with all-to-all connected qubits by default. Transpile a quantum circuit for the same basis get set and number of qubits as `backend` but with a linear coupling map `cm` of type `CouplingMap` where a qubit with index *i* is only connected to the directly neighboring qubit with index *i+1*. The [coupling map](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.CouplingMap) can be passed to Qiskit's transpilation in various ways. Note that in `generate_preset_pass_manager` the `backend` parameter takes precedence over `basis_gates` and `coupling_map` parameters, i.e. if the `backend` is set, the latter parameters are ignored.

As Qiskit is applied to a variety of quantum circuits that each exhibit different structures, Qiskit's default transpilation used in the previous exercise must perform well on an arbitrary quantum circuit. It is challenging to consider the many transpilation trade-offs when developing a highly versatile transpiler, so we will focus on quantum Fourier transformation quantum circuits introduced in the previous exercise.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore, we try to reduce the QFT quantum circuit size after transpilation by at least 20% compared to Qiskit's default transpilation. Note that you can achieve this reduction in circuit size by only using a suitable selection of passes included in Qiskit. It is not necessary to create a new pass. Review the second half of the transpilation lecture given by Matthew Treinish to get an insight into the different transpiler stages. In particular, this exercise requires setting a routing method that works especially well on star-shaped quantum circuits in combination with an optimization stage that removes superfluous two-qubit gates in a two-qubit block. These two stages are sufficient to reduce the transpilation effort below the given 20% threshold."

    "Hints:\n",
    "* First try to set a routing method that is especially well suited for star-shaped quantum circuits such as QFT. The routing method may appear to require a larger amount of two-qubit gates because of superfluous two-qubit gates. These should be removed by a subsequent optimization stage.\n",
    "* Note that for a block of two-qubit and single-qubit gates on a pair of qubits, at most three CX gates and (up to eight) single-qubit gates are necessary. If you notice that your quantum circuit has two-qubit blocks with more CX gates, apply passes such as `UnitarySynthesis` (and its prerequisites `ConsolidateBlocks`, `Collect2qBlocks`) to rectify this.\n",
    "* Reaching the 20% threshold is entirely possible by only setting the routing stage and optimization stage, other stages such as the layout stage are not required to be set to reach that threshold.\n",
    "* The definition of Qiskit's default passmanagers can be inspected [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/level3.py), [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/common.py) and/or [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/qiskit/transpiler/preset_passmanagers/builtin_plugins.py). You can also inspect the included passes in a given pass manager `pm` by calling `pm.draw()`.\n",
    "* You can either start with a default pass manager by calling `generate_preset_pass_manager` and modify the existing stages or define your own pass manager as shown below."
